## Effect of 3-Column Layout

- **Effect**: The 3-column layout arranges the sections (`units-completed`, `images`, and `video`) side by side in a grid format.
- **Reason**: This layout provides a more organized and visually appealing structure, making it easier for users to view the content without excessive scrolling.

## Effect of JavaScript Interactivity

- **Effect**: The light/dark mode toggle changes the appearance of the page, providing a different visual experience. The image swap functionality allows users to interact with the image gallery dynamically.
- **Reason**: These interactive features enhance user engagement and provide a more dynamic and customizable user experience.
