      The key highlight of the iPhone 16 Pro is the camera—a 48 MP Pro Camera system capable of taking great pictures and videos. Improved camera technology would enhance low-light performance and HDR functions with machine learning and computational photography. From Night Mode to Pro RAW, the iPhone 16 Pro is an excellent tool for professional photographers and casual users.

      The iPad Pro has increased the iPad range since introducing the M4 chip. This chip, culled from its custom silicon architecture at Apple, ensures this is no tablet but a powerful computing device that can run tasks usually done on laptops and desktop computers.
    </p>
    <p class="product-info">
      An iPad Pro has an enormous 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display to guarantee first-class visuals. It is great for photo and video editing, content creation, and media consumption with HDR10, Dolby Vision, and wide-colour P3. The iPad Pro will surely be worth it in creative professionals' workflows, especially those focusing on graphic design, animation, and video editing. It gives the pencil unparalleled drawing capability, which lets the artist work from outside the office while maintaining quality.
    </p>
    <p class="product-info">
      Another strong point of the iPad Pro is its advanced multitasking through iPadOS. In fact, with Stage Manager, users can open multiple windows that also resize dynamically, significantly improving productivity and efficiency. That means users can open a video project or a reference document and browse the web from the same device.
    </p>
    <p class="product-info">
      Beyond its creative functionalities, the iPad Pro-M4 excels in games and AR. The M4 chip boasts a neural engine that makes the tablet decent for running AR apps smoothly. Hence, it is an excellent tool for developers and those who want to enjoy AR immersion. From professional to entertaining functions, it is varied; a device that could narrow the gap between tablets and laptops.
