# Password Demo Server

This project contains a simple Express based web server
application and a matching front-end.  It is intended
as an example of handling passwords and storing them.

The server also serves files from the `public` folder using `express.static()`.
This is used to serve a simple front-end page that uses both of the
server endpoints.

## Installation

To install the required packages run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Server

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This should start the server on <http://localhost:3144>.
