# COMP2110 Week XX

Briefly summarise the work you've done this week here.

This is second change in local repo.

This week's work focused on creating web components using Lit to display Star Wars data from the SWAPI API. The implementation includes:

1. A page header component for displaying the title and logo
2. A page footer component showing copyright information
3. A Star Wars movie component that displays film details and allows users to switch between different films
4. A Star Wars character component that displays individual character information in card format
5. Integration of character data within the film component to show all characters featured in the selected film

The components demonstrate key features of Lit including:
- Property definitions and reactivity
- Lifecycle callbacks (connectedCallback and updated)
- Event handling
- Rendering dynamic content from API data
- Styling with CSS
- Component composition

Each component fetches data from the SWAPI API and renders it in a visually appealing format with consistent styling.
